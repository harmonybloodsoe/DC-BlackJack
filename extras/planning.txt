* step one- styles
Create stylesheet containing room for player and dealer deck, as well as  buttons that clearly display the 
options to deal, hit, and stand

* step two- planning
Draw a theoretical page that explains what every element would be doing and starts to flesh out what tools 
are necessary for this project. For this I used the sample styles that were provided

* step three- dealing
Create a function that deals two unidentified cards to the player and two to the dealer (optional: one of the 
dealer's cards is not visible until the player makes their first move)
    >create an event listener that listens for click, and tell it to run the function "toDeal" on the click
    >toDeal will add two card objects to the playerDeck and dealerDeck arrays

* step four - creating the deck
Create a function that makes a deck containing all 52 cards. 
For some reason it was very hard for me to conceptualize dealing the cards without creating them first so I 
decided to do this first and come back to dealing them.
    >create a object constructor that creates a card object with the properties of rank, suit, and an img file 
    string that is created from the interpolated strings of rank and suit (these will correspond to the image 
    names in another file)
    >add a nested for loop that creates 13 card objects for every suit and pushes it into the empty deck array
    >faceCard function will change the img file name for the face cards 

* step four - dealing part two
Using the deck function create a function that deals one card to each hand on default but can deal any amount 
of cards to any player. This will serve for the hit button as well
